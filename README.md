  Elizabeth: '484-584-2923'
}
```
Write code to do the following:


1. Print Elizabeth's phone number.
2. Add a entry to the dictionary: ```Kareem's``` number is ```938-489-1234```.
3. Delete Alice's phone entry.
4. Change Bob's phone number to '968-345-2345'.
5. Print all the phone entries.


## Histogram

Write a function ```histogram``` which takes a string as argument. It will tally(histogram) the number of times each character appears in the string, and return the tally as an object. Example:

```javascript
> histogram('bananas')
{ b: 1, a: 3, n: 2, s: 1 }
```
*Note: the order of the keys doesn't matter.*
